# - provides a cpack target with a default to TGZ generator and overridable
#   defaults which can be specified in external files. 
#
# INCLUDE this file somewhere at the end of your main CMakeLists.txt. Afterwards
# a package target will be available over CPack and handling is
# available so that different CPack settings can be specified in additional
# files which can be passed in over the CPACK_CONFIG_FILE variable. These files
# should contain definitions of CPACK_* variables.
